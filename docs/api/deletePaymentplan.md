    foreach ($plans->paymentplans as $plan) {
        if ($plan->activeSubscriptions == 0 && !$plan->isActive) {
            // Safe to delete - no active subscriptions

                paymentplanId: $plan->paymentplanId
            );
            echo "Deleted inactive plan: {$plan->name}\n";
        } else {
            echo "Skipping plan '{$plan->name}' - has active subscriptions\n";
        }
    }
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: {$e->getMessage()}\n";
}
```

## Error Responses

| Code | Message | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid parameters | Invalid payment plan ID |
| 404 | Payment plan not found | Specified payment plan does not exist |
| 403 | Access denied | No permission to delete this payment plan |
| 409 | Plan in use | Cannot delete plan with active subscriptions |

## Notes

- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Payment plans with active subscriptions cannot be deleted
- Deactivate plan first to prevent new subscriptions
- Wait for existing subscriptions to end before deletion
- Alternative: keep inactive plan for historical reference
- Statistics history will be lost after deletion
- Consider exporting subscription data before deletion
