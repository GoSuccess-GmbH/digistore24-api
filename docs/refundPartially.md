# refundPartially

Partially refund a purchase amount.

## Description

Refunds a partial amount of a payment without changing the order status. The refund amount is treated as a discount applied to the purchase.

This is useful when you want to:
- Give a partial refund for incomplete service
- Apply a discount after purchase
- Refund part of a payment while keeping the order active
- Compensate customers for issues without canceling their access

**Important differences from full refund:**
- Order status does NOT change
- Customer retains access to products/services
- Only a portion of the payment is refunded
- Refund is treated as a discount, not a cancellation

            echo "✗ Failed to refund {$refund['purchase_id']}\n";
        }
        
        // Rate limiting: Wait between requests
        usleep(500000); // 0.5 second delay
        
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        $failed++;

### 6. Customer Complaint Resolution

Handle customer complaints with partial refunds:

```php
use GoSuccess\Digistore24\Digistore24;
use GoSuccess\Digistore24\Request\Billing\RefundPartiallyRequest;
use GoSuccess\Digistore24\Request\Purchase\GetPurchaseRequest;

// Initialize API client
$config = new Configuration('YOUR-API-KEY');
$client = new Digistore24($config);

function resolveComplaint(
    Digistore24 $client,
    string $purchaseId,
    int $satisfactionPercent
): void {
    // Get purchase details first
    $getPurchaseRequest = new GetPurchaseRequest($purchaseId);
    $purchase = $client->purchases()->get($getPurchaseRequest);
    
    $purchaseAmount = $purchase->getAmount();
    
    // Refund based on satisfaction level
    // 100% satisfied = no refund
    // 0% satisfied = full refund (use full refund endpoint instead)
    // 50% satisfied = 50% partial refund
    
    if ($satisfactionPercent < 100 && $satisfactionPercent > 0) {
        $refundPercent = 100 - $satisfactionPercent;
        $refundAmount = ($purchaseAmount * $refundPercent) / 100;
        
        $request = new RefundPartiallyRequest(
            purchaseId: $purchaseId,
            amount: round($refundAmount, 2)
        );
        
        $response = $client->billing()->refundPartially($request);
        
        if ($response->wasSuccessful()) {
            echo "Partial refund of {$refundPercent}% (€{$refundAmount}) processed\n";
            echo "Customer retains access to product\n";
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
resolveComplaint($client, 'COMPLAINT999', 70); // 30% refund
```

## Error Handling

```php
use GoSuccess\Digistore24\Digistore24;
use GoSuccess\Digistore24\Request\Billing\RefundPartiallyRequest;
use GoSuccess\Digistore24\Exception\ApiException;
use GoSuccess\Digistore24\Exception\ValidationException;

// Initialize API client
$config = new Configuration('YOUR-API-KEY');
$client = new Digistore24($config);

try {
    $request = new RefundPartiallyRequest(
        purchaseId: 'ABC123',
        amount: 25.00
    );
    
    $response = $client->billing()->refundPartially($request);
    
    if ($response->wasSuccessful()) {
        echo "✓ Partial refund successful\n";
        echo "Result: " . $response->getResult() . "\n";
    } else {
        echo "⚠ Refund processed but with unexpected result\n";
        echo "Result: " . $response->getResult() . "\n";
        print_r($response->getData());
    }
    
} catch (ValidationException $e) {
    echo "Validation error: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    echo "Check:\n";
    echo "- Purchase ID is valid\n";
    echo "- Refund amount does not exceed payment amount\n";
    echo "- Amount is positive\n";
    
} catch (ApiException $e) {
    echo "API error: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    echo "Status code: " . $e->getCode() . "\n";
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Order Status Unchanged**: The order status does NOT change with partial refunds. Customer retains access.
- **Amount Limit**: Refund amount must not exceed the original payment amount
- **Discount Treatment**: Partial refunds are treated as discounts, not cancellations
- **Full Refunds**: For complete refunds that cancel the order, use `PurchaseResource::refund()` instead
- **Multiple Partial Refunds**: You can issue multiple partial refunds for the same purchase
- **Customer Notification**: Customers receive email notifications about partial refunds
- **Accounting**: Partial refunds are properly tracked in financial reports
